# The FusionMON Challenge
FusionMON is a challenge which has been created to incorporate the [**IronMON challenge**](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1) into [**Pokémon Infinite Fusion**](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=347883). It was initially conceived by [**Sentor_G**](https://www.twitch.tv/sentor_g) & his Twitch chat on 20/01/2023.

*At present, the list of rules and optimisations for players are being tested (4/02/2023)*

Pokémon Infinite Fusion is a fanmade game, based on Pokémon FireRed Version. The game introduces DNA Splicers (from Generation 5) which the player can use on any Pokémon they find in the game. Each combination has a unique sprite, stats, movepool, Pokédex entry, and everything else you could expect from a Pokémon. You can find out about what happens during the Fusion process [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonInfiniteFusion/comments/b01dyw/fusion_faq/). Use this [**Fusion Calculator**](https://aegide.github.io/) to see all the potential combinations! [**Here**](https://infinitefusion.fandom.com/wiki/Differences_with_the_official_games) you can find all of the major changes to the game.

The IronMON challenge was created to avoid the need for grinding on wild Pokémon in a difficult environment. FusionMON aims to replicate that need, but to have fun and experience the game in a completely new way! FusionMON requires the player to be tactical and strategic about catching Pokémon. These encounters should be aimed at being the most useful for Fusion and to aid clearing the entire game without the whole team fainting. I (Sentor) want to give a massive thank you and shoutout to Halofire for all their help and work getting this to where it is today. They are the mastermind behind the modified files to allow FusionMON to exist. I want to also thank my Twitch chat for all their continued support and help getting the rules completed.

| Calculating Fusions | The [**Infinite Fusion Calculator**](https://aegide.github.io/) may be used during runs to understand typing/stat spreads. |

| Flute rule | Any acquired Flutes may only be used **once each per Pokémon Centre heal**. |

| Move reminder | You may replace **4 moves per Fusion**. Relearnt moves must be purchased all at once (no saving moves for later). |
| One-shot Gyms & dungeons | You must clear all trainers **BEFORE** the Leader. The Leader must be defeated before you can exit. A dungeon may be re-entered for story purposes. Forests are not considered dungeons. Any leftover experience **must be avoided** during re-entry. |
| Gym Leader TMs | You may use Gym Leader TMs only **once per seed**. All other TMs are not usable. |
| HM friends | HM friends must be declared. If an HM friend is swapped in during battle due to Whirlwind/Roar, you must switch immediately. The HM friend **MUST HAVE** an ability which will not alter the outcome of the battle. For example, Run Away, Klutz, Illuminate etc. will not produce additional effects. |
| Illegal Pokémon | Pokémon which are static, traded, gifted or sold (for example, Wondertrade or Black Market) are banned. These Pokémon may be used as HM friends if their ability does not impact the battle. |
